# Game Rules

## Setup

- **Attach the bridge**
- **Place a disaster dice** on the platform by the timer rod
- **Mix up the crates** (with the symbols down) and pick 10 of them:
  - Add 3 on the route behind the stairs
  - Add 3 on the route behind the bridge tower
  - Add 3 in the space directly by the bridge tower
  - Add 1 in the starting area
- **Each player chooses a figure** to play with and draws a card for a special ability:
  - Once per game can cancel a disaster
  - Once per game can revive a teammate
  - Moves 1 extra space per roll
  - Swimmer - can not be eliminated by the river trap - place the figure back on the starting space if eliminated in the river
  - Does not have to move when landing on an arrow space
  - Once per game, can avoid a negative effect from a crate
  - Rolls a 'Helping Hand' dice each turn. Can save a player from a disaster this turn for each hand rolled
  - Rolls a 'Helping Hand' dice each turn. Can move a teammate 1 space for each hand rolled
- **Give 1 green movement die** to each player
- **Set the Game Over timer** based on the number of players:
  - 2 players - set dial to 7
  - 3 players - set dial to 8
  - 4 players - set dial to 9
  - 5 players - set dial to 10
- **Set the speed of the "Flow" trap** to the lowest level. You may need to move it back-and-forth if the river and lava aren't moving

## Winning & Losing

### To win the game
Retrieve 3 relics and return them to the receptacles at the start before the Game Over timer reaches 0.

**Relics needed by player count:**
- 2 players: 3 relics
- 3 players: 5 relics
- 4 players: 6 relics
- 5 players: 7 relics

### Game is lost if:
- The Game Over timer reaches 0, OR
- All players are eliminated

**Note:** When the bridge tile, you are eliminated when their pawn is no longer upright and on a valid movement tile. Players can retrieve multiple relics over the course of a game. As soon as you drop one off at the receptacle, you can start back to grab another!

---

## The Disaster Timer

- **At the start of your first turn**, press down the plunger to reset the timer
- **The disaster timer constantly counts down**. When it reaches the end, it will roll a disaster die. When this happens:
  - Each player stops any movement that's in progress and places their pawn down on the nearest space
  - Trigger the disaster that was rolled from the device
  - Rotate the Game Over Timer to reduce it by 1
- **After the disaster**, reset the timer by pressing it down

---

## Turns

- All players take a turn at the same time. The next turn cannot begin until all players have completed this turn. **You're only as fast as your slowest player!**
- There are no limits to the number of turns that you can take in a game
- In each turn all players must roll their movement dice of their choice along with any dice for their special ability
- **If any player rolls a disaster icon**, get the special disaster dice and:
  - Roll the dice then trigger the corresponding disaster
  - Rotate the Game Over Timer to reduce it by 1. **If it reaches zero, the game is over** and the players lose
  - If multiple disaster icons are rolled, roll the disaster dice for each
- All players must complete their movement and actions before the whole group can begin the next turn

---

## Taking Actions

Before, during or after your move, you can take one of these actions (if available):

### Destroy an adjacent crate
Check the symbol on the bottom of the crate, take the action & remove the crate from the game board. Potential actions include:
- **Upgrade your movement die** to a red dice - it has twice the movement!
- **Take the golden movement die** - it has the greatest movement by far and the same level of risk as the red die
- **Save crate** - You can save this crate and use it in the future to prevent a single disaster
- **Revive teammate** - place them within 3 spaces of where they were eliminated. Any player can use this immediately or later in the game
- **Trigger an immediate disaster**

### Other actions
- **Move an adjacent moveable block** up to 1 square to a valid movement location
- **Put an adjacent relic** in your backpack by sliding it into the slot
- **Put a relic from your backpack** into an adjacent relic slot
- **Sacrifice a froma figures backpack** and reduce the timer speed to the minimum value. Be sure you leave enough relics to be able to win the game! This is a risky maneuver but a fast-running timer can spell disaster

---

## Movement

- **Players must move** their pawn the number of spaces shown on their movement dice. Players can choose to move their pawns at the same time or in any order they'd like
- **If your turn starts on top of a trap**, you get +2 to your movement. This small risk can be a huge help by increasing your movement through a game
- **If your final move is on a space with an arrow**, you must move one space in that direction if it is not blocked
- **Movement can include a single change in elevation** space if it's not taller than the pawn
- **Two pawns cannot occupy the same space**. If this is unavoidable, the second pawn to move should be placed one space behind the first
- **Each section of the bridge counts as a single space**
- **Pawns cannot move past each other or hop over**. If you're on a path that's only one space wide, one player will have to turn around
- **Some spaces on the board may be moving**. In this cases, use your best judgement to determine if they are aligned at the moment your piece is moving

## Notes about Traps

- **When the bridge falls**, you will note that it also blocks the path back behind the lava tower
- **If something odd happens** (like the wall trap not rotating perfectly) it is recommended to proceed to the spirit of the game. This means, just act like it happened the way it was supposed to!
